Act as a senior software engineer working inside a Replit environment.

Build a web-based location-based attendance system for a tertiary institution.
The system must be realistic, secure, simple, and explainable.

==================================================
IMPORTANT LIMITS (MUST FOLLOW)
==================================================

- Do NOT assume any specific programming language unless asked
- Use only browser-supported capabilities and basic server logic
- Do NOT rely on paid APIs or external services
- Do NOT add biometric or face-recognition features
- Do NOT auto-create student accounts
- Do NOT invent features outside the scope below
- If something is unclear, ask before assuming

==================================================
PROJECT GOAL
==================================================

Lecturers create attendance sessions.
Students can mark attendance ONLY when they are physically present
within a defined GPS radius during an active session.

==================================================
ACTORS
==================================================

1. Student
2. Lecturer (Admin)

==================================================
STUDENT ACCOUNT LOGIC
==================================================

- Student records are preloaded using ONLY Index / ID Numbers
- No passwords exist initially
- First-time access flow:
  - Student enters Index / ID Number
  - System verifies the Index Number exists
  - If no password is set:
    - Student creates a password
    - Password is stored securely
    - Account becomes active
- Returning students log in using Index Number + password

==================================================
ATTENDANCE SESSION LOGIC
==================================================

- A lecturer creates an attendance session with:
  - Course
  - GPS latitude and longitude
  - Allowed radius (in meters)
  - Start condition and end condition
- A student may mark attendance ONLY IF:
  - Session is active
  - Student is authenticated
  - Browser grants location access
  - Student location is within the allowed radius

==================================================
DEVICE & SESSION CONTROL
==================================================

- One device may have ONLY ONE active session at a time
- One device can not login two different account only if the session starts even when student logs out and tries to login another account
- Device restriction is per session, not permanent
- Use non-invasive browser or platform information to identify a device
- If a device already has an active session:
  - Block new login attempts from that device

==================================================
DATA STRUCTURE (STRICT)
==================================================

Use ONLY these data entities:

1. Students
2. Lecturers
3. Courses
4. Attendance Sessions
5. Attendance Records
6. User Sessions (for device/session control)

- Keep schema minimal
- Avoid unnecessary fields
- Explain each entity clearly

==================================================
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

- Never store passwords in plain text
- Validate attendance server-side
- Prevent duplicate attendance entries
- Protect sessions from hijacking
- Do not trust client-side data blindly

==================================================
UI / VISUAL RULES
==================================================

- The interface should look modern and academic
- Subtle animations are allowed
- 3D or animated visuals may be used ONLY as background decoration
- Visuals must NEVER control authentication or attendance logic

==================================================
WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT
==================================================

Proceed in this order:
1. Explain the full system flow step-by-step
2. Design the database schema
3. Build authentication and onboarding
4. Implement attendance logic
5. Add UI enhancements last


lecturer should know all students in the system. in a students page in the lecturer sidebar. so after every session or class, students who attended shows green light and others show red
after one hour of closure the lights should go off

lecturer can also add students manually through the system

Do NOT jump ahead.
