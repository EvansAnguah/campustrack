## Packages
uuid | For generating persistent device IDs
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and animations
lucide-react | Already in base stack, but emphasized for iconography

## Notes
Device ID generation logic needs to run on app initialization.
Geolocation API usage requires handling permission states carefully.
Font selection: 'Inter' for UI, 'Space Grotesk' for headers/numbers.
